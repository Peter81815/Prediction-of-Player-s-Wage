# Prediction-of-Players-Wage
Introduction                                                                                                                 
In this project, we investigated the FIFA soccer players dataset and trying to build the model that can predict the players' wage. The data is scraped from the website https://sofifa.com by extracting the Player personal data and Player Ids and then the playing and style statistics in FIFA 2018.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
                   
Background                                                                                                                   
With the growing numbers of soccor players in each club, how to evaluate a player’s wage and give them a proper position targeting have become a big problem for each soccor club. Developing an appropriate positioning method and salary level will effectively improve this situation.

Goals                                                                                                                       
The purpose of this project is to establish an evaluation plan for the player’s wage depending on their personal information, the position they are playing in the match, the goals and mistakes they perfrom in the match and so on.

 Methodology
