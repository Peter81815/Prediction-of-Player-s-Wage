# Prediction-of-Players-Wage
Introduction
In this project, we investigated the FIFA soccer players dataset and trying to build the model that can predict the players' wage. The data is scraped from the website https://sofifa.com by extracting the Player personal data and Player Ids and then the playing and style statistics in FIFA 2018.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
                   
Background
With the growing numbers of soccor players in each club, how to evaluate a player’s wage and give them a proper position targeting have become a big problem for each soccor club. Developing an appropriate positioning method and salary level will effectively improve this situation.

Goals
The purpose of this project is to establish an evaluation plan for the player’s wage depending on their personal information, the position they are playing in the match, the goals and mistakes they perfrom in the match and so on.

Methodology
1. Linear Regression
In statistics, linear regression is a linear approach to modelling the relationship between a scalar response and one or more explanatory variables. The case of one explanatory variable is called simple linear regression. For more than one explanatory variable, the process is called multiple linear regression. This term is distinct from multivariate linear regression, where multiple correlated dependent variables are predicted, rather than a single scalar variable.

2. Logistic model
In statistics, the logistic model is a widely used statistical model. In its basic form it uses a logistic function to model a binary dependent variable, although many more complex extensions exist. In regression analysis, logistic regression is estimating the parameters of a logistic model. Mathematically, a binary logistic model has a dependent variable with two possible values, such as pass/fail, win/lose, alive/dead or healthy/sick; these are represented by an indicator variable, where the two values are labeled "0" and "1".

3. Step-wise Regression
In statistics, stepwise regression is a method of fitting regression models in which the choice of predictive variables is carried out by an automatic procedure. In each step, a variable is considered for addition to or subtraction from the set of explanatory variables based on some prespecified criterion. Usually, this takes the form of a sequence of F-tests or t-tests, but other techniques are possible, such as adjusted R2 and Akaike information criterion.

4. Interaction effects & Regularization
In statistics, an interaction may arise when considering the relationship among three or more variables, and describes a situation in which the effect of one causal variable on an outcome depends on the state of a second causal variable. Although commonly thought of in terms of causal relationships, the concept of an interaction can also describe non-causal associations. Interactions are often considered in the context of regression analyses or factorial experiments.
